# RNBO_SchroederReverb

This is a Schroeder Reverb by RNBO (Max Msp).  
I have also arranged the code to use the [AudioProcessorValueTreeState](https://docs.juce.com/master/classAudioProcessorValueTreeState.html).
Built from the [rnbo.example.juce](https://github.com/Cycling74/rnbo.example.juce).  

For *Getting Started*, please refer to the original repository. Also included in this repository is the C++ program output from RNBO in `export/`. And Max patch is included in `patches/`.

## Parameter explanation
- **Mix** : You can control the ratio of dry sound to wet sound.

- **Del All-Pass Filter** : Determines the sound diffusion to create reverberation by blurring the intervals of periodic echoes generated by the comb filters.  
SchroederReverb provides two allpass filters, each with a delay time of *1.0 for allpass filter 1, *0.340 for allpass filter 2.

- **Del Comb Filter** : Determines the echo interval that forms the basis for early reflections and the density of reverberation.   SchroederReverb provides four comb filters, each with a delay time of *1.0 for comb filter 1, *0.906 for comb filter 2, *0.835 for comb filter 3, and *0.757 for comb filter 4.
